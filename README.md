# Barely
A low level programming greatly inspired by the fundementals of C.

# Using
Barely is a self-hosted programming language, which means the compiler is completely written in Barely itself. Currently, there is no system for distributing the self-hosted compiler binary. If you want the binary, create an issue or get in contact with me some other way.

# Documentation
See examples directory, none yet.
